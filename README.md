Udacity Data Science Project

# Project Summary:
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nonadegree Class. The aim is to analyse a dataset from Starbucks, combining different data sets to identify which factors influence the successful use of an offer.

The three question that shall be answered are the following:
a) Which groups of people are most responsive to offers?
b) Is there a difference between different offer types?
c) How best to present each type of offer?


# Data:
The project data is provided by Starbucks through Udacity. The dataset contains three data files: (1) portfolio, (2) profile and (3) transcript.


# Project Files:
portfolio.json: 
The data set includes information to specific offer types: BOGO (buy one, get one free), discount, information (without any reward). (Further information can be found in the notebook)

profile.json:
This file includes the information to the customers (e.g. age, gender, income and the date he/she became member).

transcript.json:
This dataframe includes the transaction data (e.g. information about when a customer received, viewed or completed an offer and also when a customer made a transaction).


# Results: 
As membership duration is the factor with the highest influence on offer completion, a loyality programm can be an effective method to implement. The use of channels should be tailored to the different offer types and emails should not be regardes an effective marketing tool.Â 
The analysis could be deepend by looking at interaction features (e.g. channel and customer characteristic) and the effect of the exposure to multiple channels before completing an offer.
